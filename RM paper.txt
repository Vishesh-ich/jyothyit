AI has significant potential in enhancing cybersecurity by improving intrusion detection, malware detection, and vulnerability analysis. AI-powered security systems can identify and classify network traffic, detect anomalous behavior, and assess the behavior of software to recognize patterns indicating malicious activity. Neural network models can enhance the accuracy of intrusion detection by modeling the behavior of legitimate users and detecting anomalies. They can also improve the precision of malware detection by modeling the behavior of known malware and identifying new variants. Additionally, AI-based vulnerability analysis systems can analyze system configurations and identify potential vulnerabilities. However, challenges such as computational complexity and potential biases in training data need to be addressed when incorporating AI into cybersecurity . Furthermore, the development of AI-generated media poses new security risks, including attacks that use AI to mimic voices and the need for new security features to protect AI itself.
